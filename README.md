## Editing

Edition is already optimised for adding, updating and removing documentation

### Documentation pages

* Add, update or remove a documentation page in the *Documentation* collection.
* Change the category of a documentation page to move it to another section in the navigation.
* Documentation pages are organised in the navigation by category, with URLs based on the path inside the `_docs` folder.


### Search

* Add `excluded_in_search: true` to any documentation page's front matter to exclude that page in the search results.

### Navigation

* Change `site.show_full_navigation` to control all or only the current navigation group being open.
